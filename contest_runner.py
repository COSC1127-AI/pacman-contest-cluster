class ContestRunner:
    """Class representing one Capture the Flag contest with a set of teams in a set of layouts

    The class creates individual jobs, one per game between teams in the contest, to run each game. 
    It uses ClusterManager to run those jobs in a set of hosts, and then analyses the outputs.

    The main API interface is run_contest_remotely(.) to run one single contest with a set of teams in a set of hosts

    Function _get_game_command() generates the actual command that runs each game:

        python3 capture.py -c -q --record --recordLog --delay 0.0 --fixRandomSeed -r "{red_team}" -b "{blue_team}" -l {layout} -i {steps}

    One should distinguish two different directories:
    
        1. The temporary folder where all the data of the multi-contest will be collected into (TMP_DIR). 
            It will have subfolders for each contest with their logs, replays, etc.
        2. The output WWW folder where the HTML and data will be dumped (settings["www_dir"]). 
            Logs, replays, stats will be dumped there (plain and compressed versions) together with an HTML page
